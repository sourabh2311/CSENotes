\begin{comment}
The options oneside and twoside affect the width of the side margins.  With oneside , which is the default for article, report, and letter, the margins on both  sides  of  every  page  are  equally  wide.   With twoside, Latex distinguishes between an inner and outer  margin.   The  outer  margin  is  substantially wider  and  switches  between  left  and  right.   Even pages have their outer margin on the left, odd pages on the right.  Most books follow this structure and so it should not come as a surprise that the book class default is twoside.
The standard Latex classes (article, report etc) support ten, eleven and twelve point text. These are the commonest sizes used in publishing.
However, for certain applications there may be a need for other sizes.
The extsizes classes (extarticle, extreport, extbook, extletter, and
extproc) provide support for sizes eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
fourteen, seventeen and twenty points.	
Also as we want whole document to have two columns, we gave it as an optimal parameter however if we want a particular page to have two columns, the command \twocolumn starts a new page having two columns. Accordingly, \onecolumn starts a new page with a single column assuming you are in a two column environment as described above. Both commans do not take any arguments. 
The is a way to define the distance between the two columns, use
\setlength{\columnsep}{distance}

If you need a line to separate the columns, the following command will do the job:
\setlength{\columnseprule}{thickness}

The  page  headers  and  footers  in  Latex are  defined  by  the 	\pagestyle and \pagenumbering commands. \pagestyle defines the general contents of the headers and footers (e.g.  where the page  number  will  be  printed),  while \pagenumbering defines  the  format  of  the  page  number. Latexhas four standard pagestyles:
empty - no headers or footers
plain - no header, footer contains page number centered
headings - no footer,  header contains name of chapter/section and/or sub-section and page number
myheadings - no footer, header contains page number and user supplied information
The \pagestyle command changes the style from the current page on throughout the remainder of your document.

You can change the values of the variables defining the page layout with two commands. With this one you can set a new value for an existing length variable:

\setlength{\mylength}{length}

with this other one, you can add a value to the existing one:

\addtolength{\mylength}{length}

\itemsep = vertical space added after each item in the list.
\parsep = vertical space added after each paragraph in the list.
\topsep = vertical space added above and below the list.
\partopsep = vertical space added above and below the list, but only if the list starts a new paragraph.

\section{Making of the Constitution}

\begin{itemize}
\item Idea of Constituent Assembly (for first time) $\rightarrow$ M. N. Roy (pioneer of communist movement in India) in 1934.
\item First official demand of CA to frame Constitution in 1935 by INC.
\item 1938, Jawaharlal Nehru on behalf of INC declared that "the Constitution of free India must be framed, without outside interference, by a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult franchise’. 
\item Demand accepted by British in 1940 (August Offer).
\item In 1942, Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the cabinet, came to India with a draft proposal of the British Government on the framing of an independent Constitution to be adopted after the World War II. The Cripps Proposals were rejected by the Muslim League which wanted India to be divided into two autonomous states with two separate Constituent Assemblies. Finally, a Cabinet Mission was sent to India. While it rejected the idea of two Constituent Assemblies, it put forth a scheme for the Constituent Assembly which more or less satisfied the Muslim League. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Composition of CA}
The Constituent Assembly was constituted in November 1946 under the scheme formulated by the Cabinet Mission Plan. The features of the scheme were:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Total strength = 389 (296 - British India (292 - eleven governors provinces and 4 from four chief commissioners provinces, one from each), 93 - Princely States.)
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Criticism of CA}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Not a representative body as we didn't follow universal adult franchise.
  \item Not a sovereign body as we followed british proposals and under their permissions.
  \item Time consuming as framers of American Constitution took $approx$ 4 months. Naziruddin Ahmed (member of CA) coined Drifting Committee.
  \item Dominated by Congress.
  \item Lawyer-Politician Domination.
  \item Dominated by Hindus.
\end{enumerate}
