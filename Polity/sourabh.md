# Historical Background

* The British came to India in 1600 as traders, in the form of EIC, which had exclusive rights of trading in India under a charter granted by QE1.
* 1764 - Battle of Buxar -> They got 'diwani' (rights over revenue and civil justice) of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. This started its career as a territorial power.
  * So now EIC should make money but still it was going in debt -> british gov. had to make laws. 
  * Regulating Act = EIC Act = Charter Act (they revised T&C of charter every 20 years).
    * 1773-1793-1813-1833-1853.
* In 1858, in the wake of the ‘sepoy mutiny’, the British Crown assumed direct responsibility for the governance of India. This rule continued until India was granted independence on August 15, 1947.
* With Independence came the need of a Constitution. As suggested by M N Roy (a pioneer of communist movement in India) in 1934, a Constituent Assembly was formed for this purpose in 1946 and on January 26, 1950, the Constitution came into being.
* Legislature is the law and policy making body.
* Executive is responsible for the effective implementation of the laws/ policies passed by the Legislature.

# The Company Rule (1773 - 1858)

## Regulating Act of 1773

* it was the first step taken by the British Government to control and regulate the affairs of the EIC in India
* it recognised, for the first time, the political and administrative functions of the Company; 
* it laid the foundations of central administration in India.
1. It designated the Governor of Bengal as the ‘Governor-General of Bengal’ (among L & E powers, L powers of Madras and Bombay started to be given to this guy) and created an Executive Council (aka Governor General In Council or Calcutta Council) (they could as well perform legislative functions) of four members to assist him. The first such Governor-General was Lord Warren Hastings.
2. It made the governors of Bombay and Madras presidencies subordinate to the governor-general of Bengal, unlike earlier, when the three presidencies were independent of one another.
3. It provided for the establishment of a Supreme Court at Calcutta (1774) comprising one chief justice and three other judges.
4. It prohibited the servants of the Company from engaging in any private trade or accepting presents or bribes from the ‘natives’.
5. It strengthened the control of the British Government over the Company by requiring the Court of Directors (governing body of the Company) to report on its revenue, civil, and military affairs in India.

## Amending Act of 1781

In above act, both SC and EC had control over company's officers. To only give this power to EC the British Parliament passed the Amending Act of 1781, also known as the Act of Settlement.

## Pitt's India Act of 1784 (this Pitt's the younger was PM of England at that time)

* Brought due to non cooperation b/w EIC and British Gov.
1. It distinguished between the commercial and political functions of the Company.
2. It allowed the Court of Directors to manage the commercial affairs but created a new body called Board of Control to manage the political affairs. Thus, it established a system of double government.
3. It empowered the Board of Control to supervise and direct all operations of the civil and military government or revenues of the **British possessions** in India.

## Charter Act of 1833

* Final step towards centralisation.

1. It made the Governor-General of Bengal as the Governor-General of India and vested in him all civil and military powers. Thus, the act created, for the first time, a Government of India having authority over the entire territorial area possessed by the British in India. Lord William Bentick was the first governor-general of India.
2. It deprived the governor of Bombay and Madras of their legislative powers. The Governor-General of India was given exclusive legislative powers for the entire British India. The laws made under the previous acts were called as Regulations while laws made under this act were called as Acts.
3. It ended the activities of the East India Company as a commercial body, which now became a purely administrative body. It provided that the company’s territories in India were held by it ‘in trust for His Majesty, His heirs and successors’.
4. The Charter Act of 1833 attempted to introduce a system of open competition for selection of civil servants, and stated that the Indians should not be debarred from holding any place, office and employment under the Company. However, this provision was negated after opposition from the Court of Directors.

## Charter Act of 1853

1. It separated, for the first time, the legislative and executive functions of the Governor-General’s council. It provided for addition of six new members called legislative councillors to the council. In other words, it established a separate Governor-General’s legislative council which came to be known as the Indian (Central) Legislative Council. This legislative wing of the council functioned as a mini-Parliament, adopting the same procedures as the British Parliament. Thus, legislation, for the first time, was treated as a special function of the government, requiring special machinery and special process.
2. It introduced an open competition system of selection and recruitment of civil servants. The covenanted civil service was thus thrown open to the Indians also. Accordingly, the Macaulay Committee (the Committee on the Indian Civil Service) was appointed in 1854.
3. It extended the Company’s rule and allowed it to retain the possession of Indian territories on trust for the British Crown. But, it did not specify any particular period, unlike the previous Charters. This was a clear indication that the Company’s rule could be terminated at any time the Parliament liked.
4. It introduced, for the first time, local representation in the Indian (Central) Legislative Council. Of the six new legislative members of the governor- general’s council, four members were appointed by the local (provincial) governments of Madras, Bombay, Bengal and Agra.
