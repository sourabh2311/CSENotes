# Historical Background

* The British came to India in 1600 as traders, in the form of EIC, which had exclusive rights of trading in India under a charter granted by QE1.
* 1764 - Battle of Buxar -> They got 'diwani' (rights over revenue and civil justice) of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa in 1765. This started its career as a territorial power.
  * So now EIC should make money but still it was going in debt -> british gov. had to make laws. 
  * Regulating Act = EIC Act = Charter Act (they revised T&C of charter every 20 years).
    * 1773-1793-1813-1833-1853.
* In 1858, in the wake of the ‘sepoy mutiny’, the British Crown assumed direct responsibility for the governance of India. This rule continued until India was granted independence on August 15, 1947.
* With Independence came the need of a Constitution. As suggested by M N Roy (a pioneer of communist movement in India) in 1934, a Constituent Assembly was formed for this purpose in 1946 and on January 26, 1950, the Constitution came into being.
  * Years never imp.
  * INC officially demanded in 1935.
  * 1938-J.N.-the Constitution of free India must be framed, without outside interference, by a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult franchise.
  * August Offer - 1940 - Demand accepted.
  * 1942 - Stafford Crips (a member of cabinet) - draft proposal of constitution - Rejected by Muslim league (they wanted two autonomous states with separate constituent assemblies).
  * Nov 1946 - The constituent Assembly constituted under scheme of Cabinet Mission Plan. 
  1. Seat alloted in proportion of population.
     * $\approx$ one seat for million.
  2. Constituent Assembly strength = 389.
     * 296 = British India.
        * -4 from 11 Governors provinces. 
        * 4 from 4 chief commissioner's provinces each. 
        * Seats to be divided into Muslims, Sikhs and general (all except M&S) in proportion to their population.
        *  The representatives of each community were to be elected by members of that community in the provincial legislative assembly (these people were themselves elected on a limited franchise) and voting was to be by the method of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote.
     * 93 = Princely States. 
       * Representatives of princely states - nominated by heads of princely states. 
  * INC won 208, M.L. - 73, 15 - others.
    * Assembly included all important personalities of India at that time, with the exception of Mahatma Gandhi.
  * Seats allocated Princely were left empty as they didn't participate.
  * The Constituent Assembly held its first meeting on December 9, 1946. The Muslim League boycotted the meeting and insisted on a separate state of Pakistan. The meeting was thus attended by only 211 members. Dr Sachchidanand Sinha, the oldest member, was elected as the temporary President of the Assembly, following the French practice.
  * Later, Dr. Rajendra Prasad was elected as the President of the Assembly. Similarly, both H.C. Mukherjee and V.T. Krishnamachari were elected as the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly.
  * Dec 1946, J.N. - 'Objectives Resolution'.

    * First draft prepared in Feb/1948. The people of India were given eight months to discuss the draft and propose amendments.
  * Some provisions of the Constitution pertaining to citizenship, elections, provisional parliament, temporary and transitional provisions, and short title contained in certain Articles came into force on November 26, 1949 itself.
    * The Constitution as adopted on November 26, 1949, contained a Preamble, 395 Articles and 8 Schedules.
    * The motion (moved by Ambed.) on Draft Constitution was declared as passed on November 26, 1949. and received the signatures of the members and the president. 
      * This is also the date mentioned in the Preamble as the date on which the people of India in the **Constituent Assembly adopted, enacted** and gave to themselves this Constitution.
  * Remaining provisions came into force on January 26, 1950. This day is referred to in the Constitution as the ‘date of its commencement’, and celebrated as the Republic Day. Purposely done to keep in sync with Purna Swaraj.
  * With the commencement of the Constitution, the Indian Independence Act of 1947 and the Government of India Act of 1935, with all enactments amending or supplementing the latter Act, were repealed.

* Legislature is the law and policy making body.
* Executive is responsible for the effective implementation of the laws/ policies passed by the Legislature.

## The Company Rule (1773 - 1858)

## Regulating Act of 1773

* it was the first step taken by the British Government to control and regulate the affairs of the EIC in India
* it recognised, for the first time, the political and administrative functions of the Company; 
* it laid the foundations of central administration in India.
1. It designated the Governor of Bengal as the ‘Governor-General of Bengal’ (among L & E powers, L powers of Madras and Bombay started to be given to this guy) and created an Executive Council (aka Governor General In Council or Calcutta Council) (they could as well perform legislative functions) of four members to assist him. The first such Governor-General was Lord Warren Hastings.
2. It made the governors of Bombay and Madras presidencies subordinate to the governor-general of Bengal, unlike earlier, when the three presidencies were independent of one another.
3. It provided for the establishment of a Supreme Court at Calcutta (1774) comprising one chief justice and three other judges.
4. It prohibited the servants of the Company from engaging in any private trade or accepting presents or bribes from the ‘natives’.
5. It strengthened the control of the British Government over the Company by requiring the Court of Directors (governing body of the Company) to report on its revenue, civil, and military affairs in India.

## Amending Act of 1781

In above act, both SC and EC had control over company's officers. To only give this power to EC the British Parliament passed the Amending Act of 1781, also known as the Act of Settlement.

## Pitt's India Act of 1784 (this Pitt's the younger was PM of England at that time)

* Brought due to non cooperation b/w EIC and British Gov.
1. It distinguished between the commercial and political functions of the Company.
2. It allowed the Court of Directors to manage the commercial affairs but created a new body called Board of Control to manage the political affairs. Thus, it established a system of double government.
3. It empowered the Board of Control to supervise and direct all operations of the civil and military government or revenues of the **British possessions** in India.

## Charter Act of 1833

* Final step towards centralisation.

1. It made the Governor-General of Bengal as the Governor-General of India and vested in him all civil and military powers. Thus, the act created, for the first time, a Government of India having authority over the entire territorial area possessed by the British in India. Lord William Bentick was the first governor-general of India.
2. It deprived the governor of Bombay and Madras of their legislative powers. The Governor-General of India was given exclusive legislative powers for the entire British India. The laws made under the previous acts were called as Regulations while laws made under this act were called as Acts.
3. It ended the activities of the East India Company as a commercial body, which now became a purely administrative body. It provided that the company’s territories in India were held by it ‘in trust for His Majesty, His heirs and successors’.
4. The Charter Act of 1833 attempted to introduce a system of open competition for selection of civil servants, and stated that the Indians should not be debarred from holding any place, office and employment under the Company. However, this provision was negated after opposition from the Court of Directors.

## Charter Act of 1853

1. It separated, for the first time, the legislative and executive functions of the Governor-General’s council. It provided for addition of six new members called legislative councillors to the council. In other words, it established a separate Governor-General’s legislative council which came to be known as the Indian (Central) Legislative Council. This legislative wing of the council functioned as a mini-Parliament, adopting the same procedures as the British Parliament. Thus, legislation, for the first time, was treated as a special function of the government, requiring special machinery and special process.
2. It introduced an open competition system of selection and recruitment of civil servants. The covenanted civil service was thus thrown open to the Indians also. Accordingly, the Macaulay Committee (the Committee on the Indian Civil Service) was appointed in 1854.
3. It extended the Company’s rule and allowed it to retain the possession of Indian territories on trust for the British Crown. But, it did not specify any particular period, unlike the previous Charters. This was a clear indication that the Company’s rule could be terminated at any time the Parliament liked.
4. It introduced, for the first time, local representation in the Indian (Central) Legislative Council. Of the six new legislative members of the governor- general’s council, four members were appointed by the local (provincial) governments of Madras, Bombay, Bengal and Agra.

## The Crown Rule (1858 - 1947)

## GoI Act of 1858

* Aka "Act for the Good Gov. of India" (i.e. responsible/answerable gov.).
* Abolished EIC.

1. It provided that India henceforth was to be governed by, and in the name of, Her Majesty. It changed the designation of the Governor-General of India to that of Viceroy of India. He (viceroy) was the direct representative of the British Crown in India. Lord Canning thus became the first Viceroy of India.
2. It ended the system of double government by abolishing the Board of Control and Court of Directors.
3. It created a new office, Secretary of State for India, vested with complete authority and control over Indian administration. The secretary of state was a member of the British cabinet and was responsible ultimately to the British Parliament.
4. It established a 15-member Council of India to assist the secretary of state for India. The council was an advisory body. The secretary of state was made the chairman of the council.
5. It constituted the secretary of state-in-council as a body corporate, capable of suing and being sued in India and in England.

* The Act of 1858 was, however, largely confined to the improvement of the administrative machinery by which the Indian Government was to be supervised and controlled in England. It did not alter in any substantial way the system of government that prevailed in India

## Indian Councils Acts

* After mutiny need was felt for cooperation of Indians in administration. 

### of 1861

1. It made a beginning of representative institutions by associating Indians with the law-making process. It thus provided that the viceroy should nominate some Indians as non-official members of his expanded council. In 1862 (such years not imp), Lord Canning, the then viceroy, nominated three Indians to his legislative council—the Raja of Benaras, the Maharaja of Patiala and Sir Dinkar Rao.
2. It initiated the process of **decentralisation** by restoring the legislative powers to the Bombay and Madras Presidencies. This policy of legislative devolution resulted in the grant of almost complete internal autonomy to the provinces in 1937.
3. It also provided for the establishment of new legislative councils for Bengal, North-Western Frontier Province (NWFP) and Punjab, which were established in 1862, 1866 and 1897 respectively.
4. It empowered the Viceroy to make rules and orders for the more convenient transaction of business in the council. It also gave a recognition to the ‘portfolio’ system, introduced by Lord Canning in 1859. Under this, a member of the Viceroy’s council was made in-charge of one or more departments of the government and was authorised to issue final orders on behalf of the council on matters of his department(s).
5. It empowered the Viceroy to issue ordinances, without the concurrence of the legislative council, during an emergency. The life of such an ordinance was six months.

### of 1892

1. It increased the number of additional (non-official) members in the Central and provincial legislative councils, but maintained the official majority in them.
2. It increased the functions of legislative councils and gave them the power of discussing the budget and addressing questions to the executive.
3. It provided for the nomination of some non-official members of the (a) Central Legislative Council by the viceroy on the recommendation of the provincial legislative councils and the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, and (b) that of the Provincial legislative councils by the Governors on the recommendation of the district boards, municipalities, universities, trade associations, zamindars and chambers.

* So this was like an indirect election, the word “election” was, however, not used in the act.

### of 1909

* This Act is also known as Morley-Minto Reforms (Lord Morley was the then Secretary of State for India and Lord Minto was the then Viceroy of India).

1. It considerably increased the size of the legislative councils, both Central and provincial. The number of members in the Central Legislative Council was raised from 16 to 60. The number of members in the provincial legislative councils was not uniform.
2. It retained official majority in the Central Legislative Council but allowed the provincial legislative councils to have non-official majority.
3. It enlarged the deliberative functions of the legislative councils at both the levels. For example, members were allowed to ask supplementary questions, move resolutions on the budget, and so on.
4. It provided (for the first time) for the association of Indians with the executive Councils of the Viceroy and Governors. Satyendra Prasad Sinha became the first Indian to join the Viceroy’s Executive Council. He was appointed as the law member.
5. It introduced a system of communal representation for Muslims by accepting the concept of ‘separate electorate’. Under this, the Muslim members were to be elected only by Muslim voters. Thus, the Act ‘legalised communalism’ and Lord Minto came to be known as the Father of Communal Electorate.
6. It also provided for the separate representation of presidency corporations, chambers of commerce, universities and zamindars.

## GoI Act 1919

*  This Act is also known as Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms (Montagu was the Secretary of State for India and Lord Chelmsford was the Viceroy of India).
